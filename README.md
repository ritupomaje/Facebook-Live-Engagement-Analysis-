As a marketing consultant of a Thai marketing consulting agency, my task was to examine Facebook Live use trends in order to determine the success of video content for Thai vendors. 
Social media usage is an important component of digital marketing, and knowing which content drives the most engagement is essential to directing clients' content marketing strategies. 
The organization has long guessed that video posts produce the most engagement, and my objective was to test that theory and develop more insights in order to guide future strategy.

Through extensive exploratory data analysis, I explored the pattern of engagement of different types of content (video, photo, and text) on metrics including comments, likes, shares, and emotional responses. 
I complemented this analysis with unsupervised machine learning techniques like clustering and principal component analysis to discover patterns in engagement by content type. 
To make an estimate of video post probability and provide actionable results, I built logistic regression models that helped us verify our hypothesis and determine most important areas of content strategy improvement.

This research and analysis is not only about reiterating the importance of video content but also about ensuring clients have a well-rounded content strategy where every type of post (videos, images, and text) is utilized to the fullest to gain maximum engagement. 
With the supply of facts-based insights, we seek to enable our clients to optimize their social media plan and enhance their content performance overall.
